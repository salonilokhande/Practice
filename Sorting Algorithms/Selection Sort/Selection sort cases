🔹 How Selection Sort works (1-line reminder)

In each pass, the smallest element is selected from the unsorted part and placed at its correct position.

⏱️ Time Complexity (IMPORTANT)
✅ Best Case

Input: Array already sorted
Example:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Explanation:

Selection sort still compares all elements

It does not stop early

Number of comparisons remains the same

Time Complexity:
👉 O(n²)

⚠️ Average Case

Input: Random order
Example:

[3, 1, 4, 2, 5]

Explanation:

Full comparisons in each pass

Some swaps happen

Time Complexity:
👉 O(n²)

❌ Worst Case

Input: Reverse sorted
Example:

[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

Explanation:

Maximum number of swaps

Full comparisons still required

Time Complexity:
👉 O(n²)

🔁 Why all three cases are O(n²)?

Because Selection Sort always scans the entire unsorted part, regardless of input order.
