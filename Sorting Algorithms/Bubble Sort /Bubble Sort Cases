Bubble Sort – Time Complexity Cases
1️⃣ Worst Case

Condition: When the array is sorted in descending order
Example:
[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

Explanation:

Every element is compared with adjacent elements

Maximum number of swaps happen

Each pass pushes the largest element to the end

Example steps:

[5,4,3,2,1]
→ [4,3,2,1,5]
→ [3,2,1,4,5]
→ [2,1,3,4,5]
→ [1,2,3,4,5]

Time Complexity:
👉 O(n²)

2️⃣ Best Case

Condition: When the array is already sorted
Example:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Explanation:

No swaps are required

With an optimized Bubble Sort (using a swap flag), the algorithm stops early

Time Complexity:
👉 O(n) (only if optimized)
👉 Otherwise O(n²)

3️⃣ Average Case

Condition: Random order of elements
Example:
[3, 1, 4, 5, 2]

Explanation:

Some swaps are required

Comparisons happen for every pass

Time Complexity:
👉 O(n²)
